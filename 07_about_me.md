## *Why I Want to Learn Git & GitHub*

###### As an IS student, I need to learn Git and GitHub because they help me track my work, collaborate with others, stay organized, and prepare for real-world jobs. These tools are used by many companies, and knowing them will boost my resume and show my skills through an online portfolio. They're widely used in the tech industry, so learning them now will not only make group work easier but also prepare me for real-world jobs. Plus, GitHub is a great place to showcase my work and build a portfolio that I can share with future employers.
